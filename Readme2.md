# Part 3: Documentation & Analysis
## Challenges Encountered & Solutions
### 1. Dataset Processing Issues
- Challenge: The ASVspoof 5 dataset contains various file formats and long-duration audio samples.
- Solution: Used librosa to handle different sample rates and extract 128-bin Mel Spectrograms for uniform feature representation.
- Additional Details: The dataset consists of thousands of audio clips, categorized into real and fake samples, requiring extensive preprocessing.

### 2. Memory Constraints
- Challenge: Large dataset led to GPU memory issues.
- Solution: Applied batch processing with reduced batch_size=8 and optimized data augmentation to prevent excessive memory usage.
- Comparison: In contrast, WaveNet and Squeezeformer require significantly more memory due to their complex architectures.

### 3. Model Convergence
- Challenge: Fine-tuning with limited epochs (3) resulted in slower convergence.
- Solution: Used pretrained weights and adaptive learning rate scheduling to accelerate training.
- Comparison: Squeezeformer converges faster due to self-attention mechanisms, while WaveNet requires extensive training data for effective performance.

## Assumptions Made
- Audio samples are properly labeled as real or fake.
- Using Mel Spectrogram as input is sufficient for deepfake detection.
- A lightweight CRNN can generalize well to unseen data after fine-tuning.

## Analysis
### Why CRNN for Implementation?
- Efficient: CRNN balances spatial (CNN) and sequential (LSTM) dependencies in audio.
- Lightweight: Requires fewer parameters than transformer-based models.
- Proven Success: CRNNs have been used effectively in speech recognition tasks.
- Comparison: WaveNet excels in high-fidelity speech synthesis but is computationally expensive. Squeezeformer achieves high accuracy but requires specialized optimization for real-time use.

### High-Level Technical Explanation
- CNN Layers extract local patterns from Mel Spectrograms.
- Max-Pooling reduces dimensionality.
- LSTM Layers capture sequential relationships in time.
- Fully Connected Layer predicts whether audio is real or fake.
- Comparison: Squeezeformer replaces LSTMs with self-attention, improving feature extraction, while WaveNet relies on dilated convolutions for long-range dependencies.
